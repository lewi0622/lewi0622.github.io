I create digital and mixed media two-dimensional visual art using a unique combination of coding (JavaScript), randomness and noise, pen plotting, and hand painted elements. I strive to create a sense of movement and fluidity in my pieces. 

Even though digital art can be crafted to exacting and precise proportions, when I create my linework, I intentionally leave room in the algorithm for noise and randomness. Moving from Digital to Analog, I use an AxiDraw pen plotter to create a one-of-a-kind physical manifestation of my designs. Small imperfections are not only expected with pen plotting but embraced. Sometimes water is added, the tooth of the paper is ruined, fingerprints are left, or white ink is smeared around and scraped off; breaking rules and going against best practices is my preferred way of thinking outside the box. I am having the most fun when I find myself surprised and delighted at the outcome of each piece.

Even more important to me than any one piece, is the constant improvement and experimentation in my process. Plotting with different kinds of pens and markers, on different types of paper, and with added components of acrylic and watercolor; every new combination of media becomes another tool for adding depth and intrigue to future pieces.  

Through my art, I aim to capture the delicate balance between creativity and functionality. I want to create pieces that are both aesthetically pleasing and thought-provoking, inviting the viewer to consider the interplay between these opposing forces. Overall, my art seeks to evoke a sense of intrigue and curiosity, and I want my pieces to inspire contemplation and a sense of wonder.
