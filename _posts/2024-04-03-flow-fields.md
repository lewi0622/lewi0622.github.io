Flow fields are two dimensional Perlin Noise fields, and to my mind, often considered pass√© in the generative art community. Perhaps because of that reason,  I've been avoiding them for some time. A while back I played with the flow field code from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjoM9oKOAKY), but I never did much with it.

With all the work I've been doing with Perlin Noise generally, something clicked with me and I understood how to make a flow field using my own code, and not with the templates I'd previously seen. It always makes more sense when you do it for yourself.

Here's the first one I plotted, using Lyra Aqua Brush Duo watercolor markers on smooth bristol.
